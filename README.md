Temporal data can have different applications. Here, there is a classification for which category a sequence of data belongs to. More specifically,  sequences that corresponds to electrocardiograms, a.k.a. heart beats.

The dataset contains 5 types of heart beats, some of them corresponding to heart dysfunctions that you will be predicted.
